  <b>PBS+Short solving a 998-step maze in <1s while BFS/A* take ~0.5s and standard beam search fails</b>

## Why it’s cool

- Invented by **Arka Brahma (Class 10, self-learner)**  
- Up to **50× faster than BFS** on large grids  
- Still finds **optimal-length paths** in challenging mazes  
- Uses **polynomial sub-beam allocation**: 1², 2², 3²… → maximizes diversity  
- Lightweight, memory-efficient, works on **grids 500×500+**  
- Simple scoring: `f = path_length + heuristic`

## Benchmark Results (50×50 Grid, 30% Obstacles)

| Algorithm       | Path Found? | Steps | Time (s) |
|-----------------|-------------|-------|-----------|
| BFS             | Yes         | 998   | 0.451     |
| DFS             | Yes         | 998   | 38.71     |
| GBFS (Manhattan)| Yes         | 998   | 9.14      |
| A*              | Yes         | 998   | 0.52      |
| **PBS+Short**   | Yes         | 998   | 0.0087    |

- PBS+Short is **orders of magnitude faster** than DFS/GBFS while keeping path length optimal.
